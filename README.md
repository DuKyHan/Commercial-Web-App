# Shopping Cart Website

## Describe the idea
**Describe topic:**<br>
- In this project, our team decided to creating a E-Commerce website, inparticularly this website name Shopping Cart. This is a website which helps clients makes an easy and convinient way to buy and sell their products. Shopping Cart is an interactive e-commerce solution providing users which an opportunity to buy and sell.
- In this website we have two basic modules. The first is customers’side and from admin’side. The customer can do some basic query that related to book like: search, sell, buy….And admin can access to admin page on the website to change everything as they want and have the ability to add, delete and upload any information regarfing the products.</br>

**Motivation why our team chose this topic:**<br>
- Customers are used to purchasing things from physical stores, such as supermarkets. It requires customers to physically visit businesses and walk around different shopping shelves, as well as shop owners to stock, display, and move the items requested by customers and the above activities all cost labor and money to operate.<
- Moreover, The expansion of the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in many changes in our lifestyles; individuals are frightened to leave their houses, transportation has nearly ceased, and social isolation has become increasingly widespread.<br>
To overcome that problem our team decided to create an online book selling website to both save labor cost, everyone can buy without moving.<br>
